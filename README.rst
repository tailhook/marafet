A very experimental DSL for creating (mostly) single page applications in HTML.

It's mostly a Jade-like (or Haml-like) templating language with few features
on the top:

* Renders Virtual DOM (currently cito.js)
* Attaches streams to event handlers instead of old crappy callbacks
* Enables non-verbose CSS scoping with using classnames
* Provides python-like string formatting
